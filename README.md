Simple way to send Pebble's accelerometer data to Xively. 

Signup for a Xively.com account. Change the js file  with your account info.

Two ways to get it running. 
	Using Simply.js pebble app, host the pebbleAccelXively.js file and direct the app to it.

	Using cloudpebble.net copy the file and install on Pebble.

Limitions:
	Unless you have a paid Xively account, Xively only lets you send one request every 5sec.
	If you send it faster Xively will freeze up for 5mins.
